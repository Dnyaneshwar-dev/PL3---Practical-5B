          So, what is computer science? Generally speaking, computer science is the study of 
          computer technology, both hardware and software. However, computer science is a diverse
          field; the required skills are both applicable and in-demand across practically every
          industry in today's technology-dependent world. As such, the field of computer science 
          is divided amongst a range of sub-disciplines, most of which are full-fledged specialized 
          disciplines in and of themselves. The field of computer science spans several core areas: 
          computer theory, hardware systems, software systems, and scientific computing. 
          Students will choose credits from amongst these sub-disciplines with varying levels of 
          specialization depending on the desired application of the computer science degree. 
          Though most strict specialization occurs at the graduate level, knowing exactly what 
          computer science is (and where a student's interests fall within this vast field) is of 
          paramount importance to knowing how to study computer science.

          Its fields can be divided into theoretical and practical disciplines. 
          For example, the theory of computation concerns abstract models of computation and 
          general classes of problems that can be solved using them, while computer graphics or 
          computational geometry emphasize more specific applications. Algorithms and data 
          structures have been called the heart of computer science.Programming language theory 
          considers approaches to the description of computational processes, while computer 
          programming involves the use of them to create complex systems. Computer architecture 
          describes construction of computer components and computer-operated equipment. 
          Artificial intelligence aims to synthesize goal-orientated processes such as 
          problem-solving, decision-making, environmental adaptation, planning and learning found 
          in humans and animals. A digital computer is capable of simulating various information 
          processes.The fundamental concern of computer science is determining what can and 
          cannot be automated.Computer scientists usually focus on academic research. 
          The Turing Award is generally recognized as the highest distinction in computer sciences.

          Scientific computing (or computational science) is the field of study concerned with 
          constructing mathematical models and quantitative analysis techniques and using computers 
          to analyze and solve scientific problems. A major usage of scientific computing is simulation 
          of various processes, including computational fluid dynamics, physical, electrical, and 
          electronic systems and circuits, as well as societies and social situations (notably war games)
           along with their habitats, among many others. Modern computers enable optimization of such 
           designs as complete aircraft. Notable in electrical and electronic circuit design are SPICE,
           as well as software for physical realization of new (or modified) designs. The latter includes
           sential design software for integrated circuits
